# Selection Process

In this document you will find the selection process that can be followed to choose who should move from the Fundamentals to the Full Stack course.

As with everything at CodeYourFuture **you are welcome to edit, remix and change this as necessary to fit your specific circumstance**. You are fully in control of this process. 

## Fundamental Course Aims

It's worth restating the aims of the Fundamentals Course from our point of view. 

At it's core, this course has been created to bring the majority of our students up to the same level before they progress on to the main course. However it is also great to dig deeper into

* How **committed** people are to the course
* How well people **self teach**
* How people **ask for help** when they need it
* How well they fit into our **community**

## Selection Process

### Goal

The goal of this process is as follows

> **Above all else, we want to give people a chance.   
>   
> Our aim is to remove people who we believe to have a very low chance of succeeding or who are not as committed to the course as we need them to be.**

### Selection Spreadsheet

To begin, **create a copy** of this template spreadsheet

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoDbP8P4hD3iuovHkd\_zmFkKMHLhsXa3U6Pa7YUjZyc/edit\#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoDbP8P4hD3iuovHkd_zmFkKMHLhsXa3U6Pa7YUjZyc/edit#gid=0)

Spend some time investigating each of the categories and filling in the spreadsheet with as much visibility as you have. The most details you can add to that sheet the better.

You are welcome to add and remove columns **as you see fit** from your copy of the spreadsheet.

Each section is as follows

* **Attendance**

#### Challenge Grading Criteria

* Very Good - The student excelled at the assessment achieving all goals in the most optimal way with little to no help or issues
* Good - The student achieved all of the goals in a sub-optimal way with a little help
* Average - The student achieved all of the goals in a sub-optimal way and with some help
* Poor - The student achieved the goals but only with significant help **or** the student could not achieve some of the goals

### Groups

Make sure you split into small groups and go through a smaller set of students each. Do **not** attempt to go through all of the students as a large group. This will take a very long time.

### Process

The aim of the selection is to find the people who are obviously not ready to join the course. Broadly, if it a student has completed all of the coursework and been responsive to working then they will likely be a good fit for the course. 

#### Coursework & Attendance Pass

As a first pass, find the people that we are sure are not ready for the course. This is people who

* Have not shown any commitment to the course
* Have not completed most of the coursework

#### Technical Pass

The second pass is about finding student who didn't make the technical process that we would have hoped on the course.

Did any of the students stand out as performing poorly on then technical challenges that they should be removed from the process.

This is people who 

* Score very poorly in their 1-to-1s

Scoring poorly means

* They did not show they had learnt over the four week course
* They could not apply the learning from KhanAcademy to the 1-to-1s

Read over the [Technical & Coding Graduation Criteria](criteria.md#technical-and-coding) for the course, we are looking for students who fulfil the majority of these criteria but not necessarily all of them - if we are seeing development or growth in all of the areas that is what the Fundamentals is about. 

#### Soft Skills Development Pass

Finally, the Soft Skills pass should try to work out if the students will be a good fit for the course. 

This is people who

* Were actively disruptive in lessons 
* Were actively rude or dismissive of volunteers or other students

Read over the [Personal Development Graduation Criteria](criteria.md#personal-development) for the course, we are looking for students who fulfil the majority of these criteria but not necessarily all of them - if we are seeing development or growth in all of the areas that is what the Fundamentals is about.
