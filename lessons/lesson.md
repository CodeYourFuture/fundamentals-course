# Week 1

## Welcome \(30 minutes\)

Welcome to Code Your Future and to the world of programming! 

This course was designed for people new to coding as well as more experienced people. Now that you have built a website in CodePen, we'll look at the basics of how programming works. We will start writing our own programs and what you can make with programming. We will also explore what kind of jobs are available to programmers.

## Introduction to Code Your Future \(30 minutes\)

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes.md#past-slides)

Before we get started with programming we want to learn a bit about you, and you can learn a bit about us.

We'll start with some introductions so that we can get to know each other. We'll also play some games.

When we've done that we have a short introduction to CodeYourFuture and this module.

## Student Agreement, Code of Conduct & House Rules \(45 minutes\)

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes.md#code-of-conduct-student-agreement-and-rules)\_\_

While you're at Code Your Future, we expect you to follow some rules. This is so that **everyone** has a fun, productive and enjoyable experience.

We'll read through the [Student Agreement](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement), [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and [House Rules](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/house-rules.html) together and answer any questions you have about them.

## Getting into Technology: Why & How \(35 minutes\)

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes.md#getting-into-technology-why-and-how-35-minutes)\_\_

Next we'll have a presentation about why you would want to be a programmer.

## What level is the class starting at? \(15 minutes\)

[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes.md#kahoot)\_\_

This course is designed for complete beginners. If you've never programmed before, don't worry - you're definitely on the right course!

We'll do a 5-minute quiz to help us find out the class's level, using the fun app called ["Kahoot"](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023).

## Software Check \(60 minutes\)

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](../teacher-resources/instructor-notes.md#slack)\_\_

Let's look at some of the tools we use to communicate with you during the course. You should have installed the following but let's check to make sure we all know what we are doing.

### Slack

1. Install Slack on your laptop \(and phone, if possible\)
2. Log in to the [Code Your Future Intro to Coding Workspace](https://cyf-introtocoding.slack.com)
3. Make sure your Slack name is your real name
4. Add a clear face photo of yourself 
5. Post 5 interesting things about yourself in a thread

### The Golden Rule of video calls on Zoom, Slack & Google Meet

Whenever you are not talking, your microphone should be muted! This prevents distracting noise for the other participants.

Keep engaged with what is happening by using the thumbs up and clapping reaction buttons and the chat feature.

### Google Classroom

To keep track of your course assignments we use Google Classroom. To set up your account:

1. Go to [classroom.google.com](https://classroom.google.com)
2. Log in to \(or create\) your Google account
3. Click the "+" button in the top right, then "Join class"
4. Paste in this classroom code that your instructor gives you and click "Join"

#### Submitting homework on Google Classroom

Once you have joined the class, click the "Classwork" button at the top. You will see the list of Week 1 homework. To submit homework:

1. Click on the piece of homework you have completed
2. Click the "View Assignment" button
3. Click the "Add or Create" button on the right hand side
4. Here you can provide a link to homework that you have completed, or upload a file

Go ahead and submit the first assignment now, "first assignment: what's your favourite music?", so that we can see Google Classroom is working for you!

## Tips for success

[Here is a list of some tips for success on the course](../other-resources/tips-for-success.md). We'll discuss some of these next week, and add to these as we progress.

Make sure you understand the first tip now \("don't hide when you don't know"\). If you have questions, let the volunteers know. You can use the raise hand button in the chat tools, or ask a question in the chat thread.

## Feedback

To make our course better we love to hear your feedback. Please spend two minutes completing this form.

[Class Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScq8Zgr0pz7aMDj0D768eCpW798XgtDsKfpA6BquqK5Hdtj4A/viewform?embedded=true&entry.1672476057=Fundamentals&entry.74981796=Week+1)

## Coursework

As part of your learning journey with CYF you will be expected to work at home on projects that we set for you. This will help you practice what you learn in class and get prepared for next week.

You will always be able to see a list of your coursework assignments on Google Classroom.

Your first week assignments will mostly be:

* working on a introduction to programming course 
* preparing a very short presentation for the rest of the class
* working on your learning plan

### 1. Code.org Course 3

[Code.org](https://code.org) is a website which teaches beginners how to code and gives them lots of practice.

It uses block-based coding \(we'll start JavaScript next week\). Don't be put off by the simplicity - even top universities teach block-based coding \(e.g. Berkeley & Harvard\).

We will be completing the course called "Course 3".

To get set up, follow these instructions:

1. Follow the instructions for registering a Code.org account provided by the instructors
2. Start by clicking on [item 1 from lesson "2. Maze"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1). \(Yes, you should skip lesson 1\). Let the instructors know if you get stuck - it is easiest for us to help you during class
3. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete all stages of ALL lessons **EXCEPT** the ones below

**SKIP** all of the lessons starting with these numbers:

* 1
* 4
* 9
* 10
* 18
* 19
* 20

\(All of the lessons starting with "Unplugged Activity"\)

Once you're finished, press submit in Google Classroom, and please add a comment mentioning your Code.org username.

### 2. Prepare a presentation for the next class

Part of being a programmer is communicating your ideas to other people on your team.   
  
To help you practice this very important skill, we want you to **pair up with someone** else in the class and prepare a short **\(8 minute\)** presentation about something you learned during the week.   
  
You will work with each other to create your talk. You must divide the time equally between you.   
  
You can use [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/q/pro/presentations/) if you want to prepare slides \(this is optional\).

Here is a list of topic ideas which you could present about:

* Why are the "Repeat" and "Repeat Until" blocks useful?
* Why are "Functions" useful?
* Why is the "Conditional" block useful?

If you want to present a different idea, that is fine as well. Then next week, you'll each present what you learned to a few students in the group.

### 3. Learning How to Learn course \(4 hours\)

[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is a video course on the Coursera site that teaches you how to be the most effective at learning.

1. Click the "Join for Free" button and sign up for an account \(**Do not pay for the course!** But this means you won't get a certificate at the end.\)
2. Work through the assignments for **Week 1** of the course. It should take around 4 hours to complete.
3. The optional assignments are not required. You can do them to extend your learning. 
4. When you complete the exercises for the week  go to the grades area and post a screenshot in your student area on Google Classroom which shows what you have done.

![Example Coursera screenshot to upload](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-05-18-at-13.20.34.png)

### 4. Get started with reflective journaling

Through out the Fundamentals Course and the Full Stack, we will assist you to reflect on your learning in a journal. This means you will write about what you learned and how you will apply that learning.   
  
Please read this [Introduction to Reflecting on Experience](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience) from the University of Edinburgh.
Next read about the [What? So what? Now what?](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/what-so-what-now-what) model of reflection.   
You will be using this model in another assignment this week. 

### 5. Get ready for remote learning

We will be working remotely while government regulations prevent large gatherings. As you will be learning at home, it's important to make sure you have what you need to study effectively.

1. Read this article on [Tips for Studying Online](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/tips-studying-online-and-home-university-students#)  
2. Write a refection using the [What? So what? Now what?](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/what-so-what-now-what) model of reflection.  Ask yourself if you have everything you need to do the actions in the article. If you don't, what do you need? Who do you need to talk to? What do you need to do?  Make a plan of what you need to do. Post your reflection in your workspace on Google Classroom. 
3. Choose a space in your home where you will be studying. let everyone you live with know this is your study space. 
4. Set it up with the supplies you will need to study and attend class. \(If you need a laptop, webcam, internet or childcare please speak to your city coordinator\)
5. Take a photo of your workspace and post it to your workspace on Google Classroom. 

### 6. Write an "algorithm recipe"

Programming is all about writing _algorithms_. What is an algorithm?

1. Read this [section of the book](https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway/blob/master/manuscript/intro02.md#introduction-to-algorithms) the JS Way 
2. Watch [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8) on The Exact Instructions Challenge😄

These show "algorithm recipes", and the video shows that you have to think carefully when writing them!

Write your own "algorithm recipe" for your favourite food and submit it to Google Classroom. Next week we'll read some of the best algorithms to see if they have any missing steps!
