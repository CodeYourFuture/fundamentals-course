## Acrostic Poem

In the morning \(Week 1\), students and volunteers use their own first name to create a short poem. Writing their name vertically, use each letter to start a line, or be the main word in a line, that describes something about themselves. 

In the afternoon, peers review all poems and try to remember details about each classmate. The instructor then creates a short quiz \(can use Kahoot\) using the statements posted in different poems. Classmates take this fun quiz to show their knowledge of their peers.

### Example

**N** - **N**ot a fan of pie.  
**I** - I love cookie dough **I**ce cream.  
**C** - I prefer **C**ooking over eating out.  
**O** - My family has an **O**live **O**il ranch.  
**L** - **L**earning is fun for me.  
**E** - I’ve ridden an **E**lephant in Thailand.

## My Weekend in Emojis

Students are tasked with talking about what they did at the weekend using only Emojis. These should then be shared in a thread of Slack or in the Zoom chat. You should encourage the students to be as inventive as possible and to try to share something unique.

If you have time, break the students out into small breakout rooms and have them guess what each others were.

If you are more limited for time, choose a few students at random and ask people to guess what their emojis mean. 

### Example

🚶‍♂️🌲🌲🌦 = I went for a walk in a forest and then it rained

## A picture tells a story

  
Change up the text by starting student introductions with an image. Students find an image of an object that represents them or why are are taking the course.  Students share in a thread in Slack and add the image and an explanation of why they chose that particular object. Start this activity by posting your picture and explanation. Once students have completed their initial post, their job is to respond to interesting images and reply with a question. Original students reply to the question with an answer. 

### Example 

## **Lost in Space**

  
Sometimes we learn more about people through seeing their priorities. In this icebreaker, students pretend they are living on a space station for a year. Suddenly, the station is malfunctioning and they have fifteen minutes to gather only five items to take with them on the evacuating space shuttle. This is not a time for deep thought. Students are instructed to quickly type out the five items they are taking with them. Once all participants have enter their items on their initial posts, peers read through the entries to find similarities and/or curiosities. Students post replies to comment and ask questions about the reasoning behind choosing the items. Give students categories of technology, personal, and survival to start their explanation. 

**Example** 

Technology - radio

Personal - family photo, book

Survival - knife, water
