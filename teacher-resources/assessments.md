# Assessments

## Assessments

Several assessments have been designed for this course. They should be completed during the weekly class or in the weeks in between class.

### Before Starting

Make sure you have got access to [this Github repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course-assessments) before starting. It contains instructions for the assessment pieces.

### Goals

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the student is progressing. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the instructor\(s\) can decide whether the student has a good understanding of the subject.

A volunteer should be assigned to work with 1 student at a time to "pair" on a small task. It is however not quite like normal pairing: the volunteer should aim to not "give away" the answer. If the student is struggling the volunteer can ask open questions to provide a suggestion.

Note that they are framed as "1-to-1 programming problems" instead of assessments for students so they are less intimidated by them.

### Feedback from Volunteers

Even for small but significant interactions, volunteers should be encouraged to fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/GgpFkgKCRPVtTtrJ7). It's fine to skip bits of it - there's a free text section at the end.

For form administrators, that's [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13F6J1HiBvmxZy-cSrgDwVxpVAZPdjU3Rv2wsXIpmo_M/edit)
