## Shout Out Questions

At the beginning of the lesson, get the students thinking about questions that they had during the week. To avoid getting distracted with answering a question for too long, run a short session where you write down all the questions on a whiteboard.

You can then prioritise answering the questions on your own time, or split into groups to answer several questions at once.

It is also useful to get a volunteer write up the questions in a more permanent place \(e.g. [as a Gist](https://gist.github.com/)\) and share on Slack.

## Coursework In Perspective

Quick presentation to discuss how block-based programming is relevant in the "real world", as it can appear a little "childish" to adults.

Sequence, repetition with loops, conditional execution with if/else, and breaking bigger problems into smaller problems, with functions.

Possibly showing representations in JS, by clicking the "Show code" button on Code.org.

## Start Khan Academy coursework in class

It is a good idea to spend some time in the class working through the first few lessons. You can help with problems getting signed in, with the interface, etc.

However, note that most of the Khan Academy lessons start with a \(short\) video. Encourage students to bring a pair of headphones or to turn on subtitles.

### 1-to-1 assessment

While the class is working on their coursework, volunteers should begin the first round of assessments with students. They should be completing the "Code.org - Three Giraffes"

Details for this assessment can be found here.

## Assigning Homework

At the end of Class, assign the homework for this week through Google Classroom.
